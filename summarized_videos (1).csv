BEFORE YOU GO! || Things To Know || Yellowstone Vlog,11:31,103653,Adventure Endeavor,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhsc1wnGFwk,what's up guys melissa and jesse here from adventure endeavor we are in yellowstone national park today and we want to tell you five things that we hate about it yeah exactly what she said [Music] look at that line of cars to get into the park look at that construction slowdowns this is a regular thing in yellowstone but first let's make sure everybody hits that subscribe button and at the end if you like it make sure you give it a thumbs up the first thing that really drives us crazy here in yellowstone is the traffic and the crowds this is crazy it's still going it's literally going into town oh wow oh my gosh immediately oh my gosh it's going all the way down wow that's insane and that my friends is why we wake up at 5am to go to yellowstone on a saturday morning i mean it's expected because it's a very cool park but at the same time it is insane last summer we went and we actually had to abandon our camp spot that we had already paid for because we had sat in traffic for about an hour and a half and we had moved a couple miles so the traffic here can get extremely bad in the crowds i mean you can get into boardwalks and these crazy places where you literally are like waiting in a line like a disneyland so that can be tough yeah the parking lots are pretty much always full at any attraction that you stop at so it's a it's challenging it's a really popular place because it is really cool to see but it just gets so crowded that it can be hard to see everything another problem with yellowstone there are too many animals there's bison like this guy right behind us and people are constantly stopping to take photos and view the wildlife and they're not using the turnouts properly so it blocks the road and you can't even take selfies with the animals yeah what's that about i mean what's the point of having animals if you can't even take selfies so you know no selfies it causes traffic it creates dangerous situations because people are just parking on the side of the highway people don't use the turnouts so that is another big con of this park what the heck case in point some people get closer than they should uh yeah it's kind of sketchy the recommendation is 25 yards away from bison and elk they were they were pushing it right there and that guy he was uh walking towards us walking towards the path and we're like okay we're gonna get out of here this is the problem [Music] basically if it's not posted on instagram it never really happened so this is a big con for us is this park has almost no cell service so we take photos of these great animals you know that there are too many of and then we can't even post on the internet so i mean what again what's the point if you can't post it to the gram why even bother why are we even out here guys did it even really happen exactly but also on the other hand as well no cell service i mean if there's an emergency like somebody gets too close to a bison and gets gored you don't have self-service yeah so if you're looking for something on your phone if you're trying to use your gps you know you might want to plan ahead and download that map and save that so you have that because you're not going to have service so that's a con for us you know we need we need to we need to post the gram [Music] [Applause] [Music] we literally saw a guy reach down from the edge of the boardwalk and dip his fingers in but he would but it was like straight up like oh like don't be that person don't be that person there's signs literally everywhere saying don't touch the water don't touch the water don't touch the water it's very simple all right guys so the last thing that we hate about yellowstone is that it is way too big it is a huge national park and you cannot possibly see everything that there is to see all in one day you're gonna have to spend multiple days here if not a week or two yeah it can be very expensive for a family if if you're not full time i mean you could easily spend a week here if not more which is more money more fuel just more days off for work especially if you come from far away you're going to want to spend a good amount of time here which like we said can be difficult it can be expensive it's not as bad for us because we are full-timers but for most people i feel like it can be a struggle which is is a big con it's something that we're not too keen of yeah i mean look at the size of this park like can you can you guys see that they probably can't probably not see it but it's huge it's a giant oh well it would help if the map were the right side up oh my gosh but it's literally like a giant figure eight this whole entire northwestern corner of the state of wyoming it's seriously massive like i can't say it enough the very first time we came here a few years ago we only planned to spend a day and one night that was a bad choice bad choice so you definitely have to spend at least a few days exploring the park especially if you stay outside of the park in a campground or a hotel you know you're going to be driving relatively far to get in and see anything and you're going to be sitting in traffic almost everywhere you can almost whether it's construction or wildlife traffic because people gotta get their selfies so yeah and the ground is frozen up here a good portion of the year so that definitely messes up the roads really bad you know the ice freezes and melts it freezes and melts so you know road construction is a part of the every summer activities that have to happen here guys so another big thing that is a hazard yellowstone is dangerous there are you know geothermal hazards that you can potentially fall into there are bears that could attack you and there are bison and elk that could attack you as well and and let's not forget about people people can be dangerous all right guys so those are our five things that we hate about yellowstone number one it is too big you cannot possibly see it all in one day it can be dangerous because of the animals and the geothermal features and the people there is no cell phones no cell service in most of the entire park which can be dangerous if there is an emergency there's too many animals so people are always stopping to see them on the side of the road and not using the turnouts properly yep there's it's it's crowded it's a really really popular extremely crowded which leads to you know all of the interesting features being really crowded and hard to kind of get up there and see what you're looking at and that also leads to tons and tons of traffic and and the traffic is you know from people from looking at animals and then as well they're just always redoing the roads up here because the roads freeze so that is a uh a big bummer so you might think that this video is coming off as somewhat negative but these are just things that we want you to be aware of so when you do come you can have a better trip we highly recommend coming early in the mornings any day that you come because you're going to avoid the crowds you're going to avoid the traffic you're probably going to see way more wildlife early in the mornings and we also recommend downloading your maps to your phone so you have them if you need them to get around they do give you a park map but it's you know it's just okay so you definitely want to plan ahead and plan to be here for as long as you can it's going to take you a long time to get through and see everything and it's not possible to see it all so definitely plan ahead like jesse said download your maps and another thing as far as animal safety you're going to want to bring bear spray especially if you're hiking yeah so definitely important bring bear spray know how to use it know how not to use it and make sure that you stay at least 25 yards away from all animals such as bison and elk yeah no selfies guys yeah and a hundred yards away from bear and wolves yeah and one more thing as well is pack your lunch there's only a couple places in the park where you can get lunch it's gonna be busy it's gonna take a lot of time out of your day so packing a lunch packing snacks you can just have a picnic anywhere and that'll make your trip a lot better so there are fuel stops throughout the park but they are going to cost you so if you have to stop and get food or get fuel it's going to be a little bit more pricey so maybe plan ahead there are a lot of picnic areas throughout the park as well so you know be conscious of animal safety as it comes to storing your food but know that there are a lot of places where you can stop it and enjoy your afternoon with a nice picnic lunch well we really hoped you guys enjoyed this video and got some knowledge out of it i don't think it was too much negative we were kind of making a point of it at the beginning just to make a point just to be dramatic but we honestly love the park and it is great just you know try to follow these tips and tricks and it'll make your experience better and like always don't forget to subscribe and hit that like button if you enjoyed the video thanks for joining us thanks for joining us on thanks for joining us on our adventure [Music] endeavor [Music] you, melissa and jesse from adventure endeavor tell you five things that they hate about yellowstone national park. The first thing that really drives them crazy here in yellowstone is the traffic and the crowds. There are too many animals there's bison like this guy right behind us and people are constantly stopping to take photos and view the wildlife. Yellowstone is too big you cannot possibly see it all in one day it can be dangerous because of the animals and the geothermal features and the people there is no cell phones no cell service in most of the entire park. There are fuel stops throughout the park but they are going to cost you so if you have to stop and get food or get fuel it's going to be more pricey.
Yellowstone National Park (USA) Vacation Travel Video Guide,44:35,229486,Expoza Travel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znckAR_dyNg,"[Music] located in the northwest of the USA Yellowstone is a National Park of the superlative the impressive Whitewater of Old Faithful is today one of the most famous and most photographed natural spectacles in the world for more than a century this Mighty geyser has been the proud and unique landmark of the oldest National Park in the United States Old Faithful was discovered in 1870 during the first official expedition to the Yellowstone area close to Old Faithful is the 1 and 1/2 km long upper Gea Basin here there are fur geysers that are well worth a visit including Castle [Music] geyser the geyser derived its name from its appearance its lime deposits have gradually created a form that resembles a [Music] [Applause] castle the Yellowstone National Park is famous for its highly visible geological iCal processes the area close to Old Faithful not only features a number of Gees but also numerous hot springs they highlight the tremendous thermal power that Lies Beneath the Earth's [Music] surface the volcanic history of this fascinating region began around 50 million years ago with the emergence of the absaroka mountains past tectonic activity here has determined the landscape of Yellowstone right up to the present [Music] day there are huge masses of lava below the Earth's surface due to this the Yellowstone region Rises about 2 cm each year in this region the Earth has an unusually high temperature those who first came here must have been frightened of the steaming hot water pools and guises that they encountered and even the local Indians avoided the mysterious Springs so it was the white Settlers of North America who discovered this geothermal area they traveled into the remote Yellowstone region at the beginning of the 19th century on their return to civilization they told of their amazing discoveries in those days this area was referred to as the witch's bubbling kitchen however few believed these eyewitness accounts they put them down to gross exaggeration and even lies at that time there were several rumors of Hidden Treasures in the Great Wilderness of the American continent but the discovery of the grand geysers was most certainly not a fantasy that had been dreamed up by the first pioneers who had ventured into this area at the beginning of the 19th century today the grand geyser is the largest active Geyser in the world its huge eruptions occur every 8 to 14 hours the eruptions of the grand gyser last for 9 to 12 minutes and can sometimes reach a height of 60 m the spasmodic geyser is one of the most active hot springs in the National Park although its Fountain is far smaller than the others in the [Music] vicinity it derived its name spasmodic geyser due to its irregular and unpredictable eruptions of water the water comes out of around 20 openings that is situated on the rim of two large craters each Fountain varies in [Music] height the Saw Mill geyser was given its name due to a strange sound that was heard when its Fountain of water spurted up from the ground [Music] guer country one of the five regions that make up Yellowstone National Park and particularly Gea Basin are famous for their large number of hot springs and spectacular [Music] Gees as with most of the parks geysers the Autumn geyser was discovered at the end of the 19th [Music] century the geysers within the geysa Basin also date back to that [Music] time Nathaniel Langford was responsible for most of their names he was a member of the Washburn expedition in 1870 one of the first to enter the Yellowstone region at dublet P iron oxides give the stone its characteristic and fascinating color the brown partly reddish colored Stone adds yet more to the beauty of this [Music] place the first inhabitants of this fascinating landscape were the Sheep Peter Indians who settled 12,000 years ago in the region of today's Yellowstone National Park an ancient people in an ancient [Music] Landscape West of the upper Geer basins is West thumb a striking feature of the large Yellowstone Lake although the guises of West thumb are not as active as those in other areas of the park bubbling hot pools of water are still a common [Music] sight in the west thumb region it is the Subterranean super volcano Yellowstone that is responsible for the temp tempure of the water the Yellowstone is one of the largest volcanoes in the world because it is located directly above a geological Hots spot a huge cave constantly fills with Magma it is situated at a depth of 8 km and is the main reason for the Park's visible geothermal [Music] activity Abyss pool a combination of several pools is 17 and 1/2 M deep it's the deepest hot spring in the National Park the Magnificent Abyss pool contains an incredible array of colors [Music] since the 1970s the thermal activity in West thumb has shown a noticeable decline thus its many Pools and Hot Springs have cooled down this has led to an increase in the growth of algae particularly xano bacteria [Music] however it has been human activity that in recent years has transformed Abyss pull [Music] visitors to Abyss pool were once in the habit of throwing coins and other objects into the water so an opening in the spring became blocked and this has consequently brought about a reduction in the water [Music] temperature in addition to the Natural Springs and Gees it is also nature that makes Yellowstone Park so appealing the scenery here is simply [Music] magnificent the 32 km long Yellowstone Lake covers a large area south of the national park covering 300 154 Square km Yellowstone Lake is not only the Park's largest lake it's also the largest mountain lake in North America it is home to many rare waterb birds in the northeast of the lake is Steamboat point the next destination on our journey through Yellowstone National Park in recent times an increasing number of scientists have become alarmed by the increasing temperature of the Region's land surface they fear that this could lead to an increase in the activity of the super volcano the magma cave within the Earth is gradually filling up and this is causing the land in this region to rise 2 and 1/2 CM each year the steaming terrain on the banks of the lake seem to add further Credence to this Theory a new eruption of the super volcano could even change life on Earth the most recent eruption took place here around 13,000 years ago on the Northern perimeter of the lake it left a huge crater Mary Bay close to the former crater is the North most section of Yellowstone Lake fishing Bridge the perfect starting point for further exploration of this region a bridge was built here in 19002 the present Bridge dates back to 1937 as the name fishing Bridge indicates this structure was once extremely popular with the fishing fraternity it was an important fish breeding area [Applause] in 1973 fishing at Bridge Bay Bridge was banned today visitors are only permitted to watch the trouts that swim in the waters of Yellowstone Lake here fishing is strictly [Music] forbidden a few kilometers North close to Yellowstone River is a further G geological attraction mud volcano however today it is no longer active it's once impressive volcanic activity has now come to an [Music] end eruption such as those once described by members of the historic Hayden expedition of 1871 are only rarely seen [Music] today but the gases that continue to emerge from mud volcano still indicate the geothermal activity that takes place within the Earth and it continues to heat the water here [Music] mud volcanoes are actually hot springs they originate in areas that have a low inflow of groundwater the lomy ground is full of volcanic ash so the mud here is constantly heated [Music] in such places as this it is advisable to be cautious any mistakes could lead to severe [Music] scalding 1 kilom from mud volcano is the area of sulfur cauldron here the heat from the earth also emerges from numerous fissures the ground close to sulfur cauldron is not only hot it's also very muddy sulfur cauldron has a pH value of 1.3 it's one of the most cic Springs in Yellowstone National Park there is a splendid mud pool that has developed around the spring and which attracts a great deal of [Music] Interest the Yellowstone River originates in the northwest of Wyoming it's the Park's largest and longest river the Yellowstone River is more than 1,000 km long and flows in a Northerly Direction it can be extremely fast flowing and treacherous it provides an important habitat for various indigenous species of fish as well as numerous rare water Birds such as pelicans and Canadian [Music] geese while gazing at the torrential Waters of the river there is much to see many creatures like to spend their time in the shelter of large rocks and the Yellowstone Cutthroat trut is very popular with fishermen [Music] [Music] some of the karma more Northerly sections of Yellowstone River are abundant with fish and have developed into a paradise for [Music] Anglers large groups of Anglers come here to try their luck and to catch some of the rivers tasty and much prized [Music] chart the Park's Wildlife does not only inhabit the river the river banks often contain a member of North America's Animal Kingdom the Bison these Mighty Wild wild cows have become a symbol of the local forer in Yellowstone National [Music] [Music] Park the spacious grassy areas of the unspoiled Park provide a perfect living space for the Bison thanks to this Nature Reserve these massive animals have managed to survive and can still be admired [Music] today in the 19th century the Bison that once traveled the prairie in herds of a 100,000 was almost completely wiped out by the white settlers who traveled [Music] West thankfully today there are 350,000 bison on the North American continent and the largest population lives right here in Yellowstone National [Music] Park further Upstream we arrive at one of the park most spectacular landscapes Yellowstone's Grand Canyon contains a wonderful variety of spectacular Vantage points but none of them is as remarkable as that of artists point from here there's a view of the most picturesque part of the canyon typical of the canyon is the orange red color of the stone and steep rock walls that plunge down between 250 to 400 m Into the Depths below there are trees on the upper edge of the canyon that is around 32 km [Music] long a kilometer down stream in the vicinity of Yellowstone's Grand Canyon is the fascinating lower Falls the water of the Yellowstone River crashes down 94 M into the depths of the Grand Canyon a truly unique and natural [Music] spectacle lower Falls is one of the most famous waterfalls in North America those early Pioneers who first came here at the end of the 19th century were Amazed by what they saw indeed they recorded their wonderment in various written [Music] accounts close to lower Falls beyond the next Bend in the river is the wonderful Upper Falls Trapper James gimmel who traveled through this area in 1846 was the first to describe the beauty of this waterfall the power of its water is truly amazing there are several Vantage points that provide marvelous views of the waterfall here Nature has created an intriguing work of art and when the sun shines there's often a magnificent rainbow that originates at the foot of the waterfall in the northern section of Yellowstone National Park are the elevated Terraces of Mammoth Hot Springs led by Ferdinand vaner Hayden a famous geological Expedition explored this area in [Music] 1871 the C ter addesses are the main landmark of Mammoth Hot Springs the warm water that emerges from the hot springs is rich in lime and minerals that spill over The [Applause] [Music] Terraces over the course of time lime and minerals have been deposited here thus creating these striking white Terraces in the shallows between the various Terraces there is much algae and [Applause] [Music] bacteria the varying temperatures in the pools create a fantastic variety of color due to new deposits of sediment the flow of water is constantly changing so influencing and varying temperatures of on The [Music] Terraces the CER Terraces of Mammoth Terrace Springs are the subject of constant transformation during the year the pools change color several times they shine out in Hues of blue green and [Applause] red the entire area contains around 60 thermal Springs Mountain tus was once one of the most beautiful Springs in this [Music] [Applause] [Music] region however for some time now the spring at Mount Terrace has dried up thus it's less popular than it was once [Music] was manura Terrace is one of the most recent hot springs in Mammoth Hot Springs this Terrace began to form at the beginning of the 1990s again this spring has not always been active despite its young age it is managed to create in just a few years a surreal landscape of [Music] stone pallet Springs is aptly named the water here sparkles in many shades of brown and red as though from an artist's [Music] palette sulfur is also released with the hot water although the native inhabitants were well acquainted with Mammoth Hot Springs there are no traces of Indian settlements in this area perhaps they were afraid of the mysterious [Applause] [Music] Terraces even today the many invisible geological processes of Yellowstone National Park create a mysterious atmosphere but it's the Region's seemingly mystifying natural processes that have been taking place here thousands of years that are the reason why this landscape is so [Music] fascinating the hot springs and Terraces of pallet Springs create an extraordinarily picturesque scene that cannot fail to Captivate all who come here [Music] on the edge of Angel Terrace are a number of dead trees remnants of the area's most recent forest fires this place became famous for its striking White [Music] Stone [Applause] here also are Reddish rocks whose color originated due to the various bacteria in the water as in many other sections of Yellowstone National Park the geothermal activity of Angel Terrace is difficult to [Music] predict in this part of Mammoth Hot Springs the proximity of the surrounding trees and white rocks is particularly beautiful although for some time the spring on Angel Terrace has not ejected any water it has begun to Bubble once [Music] again the water that comes out of the volcanic Earth contains a lot of lime and minerals and the stone continues to renew itself with further Splendid colors and forms the Travon Terraces in the northern section of the park are extremely rare there are few places in the world that compare with this in contrast with the upper part of Mammoth Hot Springs that have now mainly dried out the water in the deeper section still continues to flow the unique value of this extraordinary natural landscape was first recognized many years ago indeed in 1872 it became a protected area after following the road South we arrived at roaring Mountain it is thought that roaring Mountain really did Roar at the beginning of the 19th century but today it's mostly a sulfit Taran field whose many Fishers belt [Music] Steam nymph lake is just a few kilometers South and is also located alongside Park Loop [Music] Road this small Lake was once mainly known as a habitat for the local Wildlife however in recent years nymph lake has aroused the interest of various geologists as a long Clift has been discovered in the banks of of the [Music] [Applause] lake a Fishhawk circles majestically above the lake it also lives in Yellowstone Park around the lake there are many reminders of the most recent forest fire in this [Music] region [Music] [Applause] although the last major fire here was in 1988 the consequences of these devastating events are still plain to see then almost 4,000 square kilm and more than 2,000 of forest were destroyed by the flames [Music] fortunately Nature has since recovered everywhere there's new life magnificent flowers and blossoms grow once again in the Region's Meadows and forests [Applause] the most recent forest fire of 1988 although devastating had a rejuvenating effect on the [Music] park indeed scientists have discovered that forest fires are part of the natural circle of life in Yellowstone National [Music] Park some kilometers south of Nymph lake is a further geothermal area the Norris Gea [Music] Basin this area is unique among the Landscapes of Yellowstone Park it's not only the Park's hottest area but also boasts the largest Geyser in the world Steamboat geyser unfortunately the activity of Steamboat geyser whose Fountain can sometimes rise to a height of 130 M can be somewhat [Music] [Laughter] irregular when examined closely the pools of Norris Geer Basin often look like miniature Landscapes that date back to prehistoric times there is no plant life here the temperatures in porcelain Basin are far too hot for vegetation [Music] another reason for the complete lack of plant life in the Basin is the high acid content of the thermal [Music] water [Music] but the high content of acid in the water favors the growth of a unique type of bacteria that creates a large variety of colors in the various Springs of this [Music] region in the green glimmering emerald Old Spring pool the blue of its 8 m deep water combines with the yellow color of the sulfur at the edge of the [Music] pool the thermal area of the Norris geyser Basin is one of the most famous areas of the national park due to its fabulous variety of hot springs and Gees despite the many visitors who come to this region the surrounding forests continue to be inhabited by Wildlife deer are particularly common and don't appear to be too much impressed by the presence of [Applause] [Music] man halfway between the Norr Gea Basin and Madison Junction is Gibbon Falls here vast masses of water race down 26 M the edge of given Falls is a remnant of the mighty Yellowstone volcano for thousands of years this section of the crater has been crossed by the Gibbon River south of the small village of Madison there's yet another beautiful waterfall in this truly amazing Park fire hall river that originates in the lower Gea Basin close to the famous Old Faithful can be extremely [Music] [Music] trous the fire hole Falls are only 13 M High although not the Park's highest or indeed largest waterfall the place is quite captivating because of its beautiful scenery and the fishfield river is also popular with anle after visiting the waterfall we enter the nearby Steep Canyon of fire hole [Music] Rivers close to lower Geer Basin is the colorfully named Fountain paint pots as its name suggests this area is particularly well known for its various bubbling mud pools the intensity of the activity in the mud pools varies throughout the [Music] year [Music] when the groundwater level is high as in springtime when the Snows have melted and there's more rainfall much of the thick mud turns into a runny [Music] liquid there are many wooden walkways here so it's easy to observe the colorful mud pools at Close Quarters but without the danger of injury due to the unpredict able eruptions of the pools in this area of Fountain paint pots there are several small [Music] Gees the deer have learned to coexist with the local geological activity there's a great deal of wildlife in Yellowstone Park [Music] following a short Journey further south we arrive at our destination the Midway geysa [Music] Basin this area features a very large number of sizable Hot Springs the spring water makes its way between the Rocks while traveling into various cracks and rivers it constantly carves out new forms in the rock for some time the excelia geyser was the world's highest geyser but at the end of the 19th century its thermal energy gradually fizzled out [Applause] however in 1985 it had a new lease of life but it's Fountain was not as powerful as it once [Applause] [Music] was a huge crater and active thermal spring have remained 250 L of hot water per second flow from this [Applause] [Music] spring the size of the spring in the excelsia geyser is only surpassed by one other spring in Yellowstone the grand prismatic spring that has a diameter of 110 m [Music] the apparent calmness of this thermal spring belies the fact that each minute more than 2,100 lers of water flow out of the grand prismatic [Music] spring this picturesque location that derived its name from the former Hayden expedition of 1871 provides yet another fascinating natural wonder at which to Marvel and which adds more Mystique to [Music] Yellowstone although Yellowstone National Park is important for North America's plant and Wildlife this 9,000 square kilm Nature Reserve is primarily a geological Park amazing fantastic incredible and wonderful how can you put into words a place that provides so many remarkable glimpses of the inner workings of planet [Music] Earth [Music]","Old Faithful was discovered in 1870 during the first official expedition to the Yellowstone area close to Old Faithful is the 1 and 1/2 km long upper Gea Basin. West thumb is a striking feature of the large Yellowstone Lake although the guises of West thumb are not as active as those in other areas of the park bubbling hot pools of water are still a common sight in the west. Yellowstone National Park is home to the largest mountain lake in North America the 32 km long Yellowstone Lake. The Yellowstone River is more than 1,000 km long and flows in a Northerly Direction it provides an important habitat for various indigenous species of fish as well as numerous rare water Birds such as pelicans and Canadian geese. Lower Falls is one of the most famous waterfalls in North America in the vicinity of Yellowstone's Grand Canyon.

Yellowstone National Park: The Ultimate Camping Adventure,30:46,45859,Cody & Kellie,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHSw6CzQWns,welcome to another adventure with dome life we are traveling northwest out of the state of arkansas so here we [Music] go [Music] hello everybody we are camping in the bridger teton national forest in wyoming we are near the grand tetons and jacksonville wyoming uh we are extremely tired we drove 21 hours in two days and but we have this awesome camp spot i mean look at this we're right next to a creek how did we find it google maps google maps we we kind of we kind of gambled but we were researching the area a while back and i found this dirt road about a month ago when we were talking about coming here and we noticed that this road went all the way through and allowed camping on it and all we did was drive and we found this we left little rock at 6 00 a.m yesterday morning and drove all the way to northeast colorado which took us i forgot how many hours but we drove probably 14 hours but we camped in the pawnee uh national grasslands it is east of fort collins we have probably put 1500 miles in in the last few days but we made it here and we made it because we're staying here for an entire week yeah we have a lot of time to explore the area and we didn't make any any reservations anywhere we're back country camping the entire way it's cold right now so yeah it's just like 58 degrees probably cold right now we've been here a while um and we're only at 7 000 something feet in elevation but if you're familiar with what's going on right now of course there's wildfires in california there's wildfires in colorado and there was a few here in wyoming so you cannot have a fire right now and we're cold however we were given the opportunity to test out a product that's not on the market yet and it's a cooker slash heater so we thought because we couldn't have fires that we would use these they might be coming out this fall and winter but it's this unit here propane hookup you can cook on the top by opening it up and flipping these over and then direct heat and then we have a smaller one here and we're just testing out both of them and this one has the small camper propane that you would use for backpacking that well if i can kind of just pick it up and show y'all attaches on the bottom like that and surprisingly i can sit this far away and feel the heat so it's working out very well because it's supposed to get down to well here probably in the negative zero so it's supposed to get down to the negative we don't know i don't know no it's not you're right i'm joking it's just that um it's that cold it's just crazy it's supposed to get down to the 20s 30s probably here in the 20s so it's going to get down to the 20s at night so since we got here kind of late oh my hair's dry um we've got some smoked cheddar this is a lavender espresso cheddar uh pitted calamante olive salami and crackers so we're gonna enjoy that we're having an adult lunchable oh my gosh it is an adult lunchable isn't it i love this stuff so we're going to eat some of this right now relax for a minute i have a pulsating headache i'm going to tell you yeah if we're acting a little quick it's because we're a little nerve-wracked we're exhausted and exhausted because i started my drive at 6 00 am yesterday morning in little rock and not mountain time but standard time or is that standard time central standard yeah yeah central standard time it was midnight when we finally got to our campground and then this morning we got up about seven and then just got here and it's six o'clock i don't know what time it is now 7 56 it was about seven o'clock when we got here about 6 30 7 o'clock so i think we're gonna unwind if we don't say too much tonight we're sorry probably just see you guys in the morning see you in the morning good morning everybody good morning it is a brisk 37 degrees in the rocky mountains of the teton national forest what was the first name of it uh bridger bridger teton national forest and we are about to get some biscuits and gravy started yes now i'm gonna do coffee first and we're discussing so we're using the oven for the biscuits but we were discussing i don't think i can have my big pot here cook the gravy and the biscuits we're gonna cook the biscuits first so that we can just warm them up a little bit in the oven after i cook the gravy this will be the first time we're gonna use this cooker in frigid temperatures so we're gonna see how it does um i've got it i just turned the burner on so we're gonna let it heat up right now but yeah i won't have enough room to put my pot over there and cook the gravy at the same time so we wait all right so my oven is past 350 that was pretty quick uh uh you know you can only use an 8x8 in this thing and there's only one uh grill i guess you'll call it but i just stacked my biscuits on top we'll just see how that goes so warm in there i just wanna just put my body in there all right so these have to go for 20 minutes i am very impressed with this oven right now someone in the comments last weekend asked if that could handle cold weather and it's doing a pretty good job it's i mean it's with holding it in between like lifetime in between 300 to 400 in between 325 and 400 or 375. and i'm keeping on this little heater back here that we've got we made a wall to help block the there isn't really much wind but there is a slight breeze and it's enough to hurt you hurt your hands and stuff right kelly yeah i have on ski gloves don't laugh at me come on hurt your hands i got all ski gloves but i made this wall here to help her reflect some of the heat back towards us from this heater and uh it's working out pretty nicely thank goodness we brought this because we were really depending on a fire but well we knew there was fires going on but we didn't know for sure what the regulations are because there's different degrees of regulations so if you are in an established campground with a metal firing you can have a fire that's the only way you can out of fire out here when we pulled in there was a big kiosk on the way into the national forest that had what is like the no symbol like circle with the line through over a fire and then it also had that over the pan fires where you bring your own fire pan and uh you can't use that you can't have a fire period at all right now which is kind of sad because we were really hoping for a fire and there's so much good firewood around here our biscuits are done i'm gonna set that down there and leave them in there to keep them warm not we'll just put them back on the burner now i'm going to get my gravy started okay so i've got some sausage and i'm going to put that in the pan and we're just going to crumble that up my sausage is done so i'm going to add three tablespoons of butter i'm gonna say that is one big box this is about two tablespoons and then i'm gonna do about half of that butter let that melt and then i'm gonna toss in some flour oh and we got more coffee uh my butter is melted all the way i'm gonna throw in some flour about 1 4 cup and i'm just gonna eyeball it uh so you gotta let the flour kinda and all this kinda cook for a little bit it's gonna thicken up and then we'll need three cups of milk so now uh this is cooked for several minutes i'm going to go ahead and throw in my milk and get my whisk out we'll just continue to let this cook until it thickens up to the consistency that you desire so my gravy is done and cody just informed me it almost looks like a queso promise you it's not it's gravy but they didn't have like a breakfast sausage and you know i like to get like the high quality stuff so i didn't get jimmy dean or anything like that but they didn't even have sage or maple they're out but this is like from boulder colorado so it's it's locally sourced but uh they had hot or regular so this is a regular and it kind of smells like an italian sausage almost yeah so we are wondering how this is going to turn out i think it'll be fine all right so now we're going to move the biscuits back over here and oh breakfast is ready ready yeah oh crap okay moving back over here yeah we're just gonna warm up you can keep that other one on top of it all right i think they're done [Laughter] it's time to eat we've got our queso slash gravy here it looks good boy that was a really good breakfast i'm not gonna lie it turned out yeah so don't hesitate to use the sausage i mean it was really good i was questioning it when i looked like queso um but the plan for today is this is a really great camp spot i cannot believe we got so lucky is to find something like this in all these spruce trees but the plan for today is we are packing up leaving this region so the idea is we're just trying to get closer to um our destinations which is jackson hall grand teton so we're gonna find another camp spot somewhere along that way um and get closer anyway we're gonna enjoy our coffee and clean up some dishes start packing up some stuff and head on the road [Music] three zero one six six okay this is getting pretty interesting there are structures back here that's actually an outhouse i mean i don't know what else that would be probably is guys i think this is an outhouse oh yeah that's an outhouse leather on it so you can pay to stay here for forty dollars a night oh my god i thought she was still in the truck so you can pay to stay here for forty dollars a night at the cowboy cabin i have no clue okay things just got wicked what this is cool i don't trust myself to be in here well this is pretty much all you need to leave do this i mean i'm talking about we might fall on you oh yeah that's what i'm talking about it ain't falling this is solid i don't know four is not solid look at this guessing evan williams hey is this hot sauce we like babe no the look on the thing on the side tell me what that said it says okay there keep that shut we did not realize that it was going to start raining and it is getting cold it is 1 46 right now and it's 39 degrees so we got a little bit of service and we're going to check the surrounding areas to see if we need to leave this area this region because it's going to be in the teens tonight if we stay here oh yeah it's going to hurt so we will keep y'all posted and let you know it has been raining all day and i knew today was gonna be bad but i didn't know that being that bad but tomorrow's gonna be so the rest of the week supposed to be really sunny but um i'm glad we started driving towards town because we're trying to find another camp spot and we drove down this road that has a bunch of camp spots and most of them are taken so we're that's what we're doing right now we're driving to find a spot but anyways when we find a spot we will let you know looks like we found a spot it's pretty good when we're surrounded by trees but the plan is we're gonna put the tent up uh since it's really cold we even saw a forest ranger asked him if do you think they will lift the burn ban after the rain today and he said no so what we're gonna do is set up the tent go to jackson hole have dinner shower we're gonna find somewhere to shower apparently there's a lot of public showers and uh enjoy the evening home sweet home so this is not a payday camp but they have designated areas as you can see their yellow sign with a number on it and you can just find one put your stuff up here but you do not have to pay and it is we are still in the bridger teton national forest we're just closer to jackson hall actually we're just one mile from the grand teton national park boundary so um we're kind of in the in a closer region where we can move around quickly do what we need to do but we might only be here one two nights just we'll see where the day tomorrow takes us and what we end up doing but now shower so all the bathrooms that had showers are closed right now so kelly and i have decided that we are just going to go ahead and eat and we are eating at the mary piglets we've eaten here once before when we came back in 2016 18 i think and this place is delicious let's go catch up with kelly [Music] so no shower for tonight no sad but we're we already discussed we don't even feel that dirty we didn't do anything today we showered yesterday so we're good but dinner was really nice that was called mary piglet the merry pigments yeah we're going to go ahead and go back to camp and just go to bed we will see you guys at breakfast see you in the morning good morning we got some ice on our tent well no longer is it ice it's actually uh it's melting it's melting now but it got cold last night and the good news is is we knew monday was gonna be bad and you always have to have one bad day in a trip especially when you're camping yeah and yesterday was cold rainy and we were we were aware of it coming into it not so much the rainy part but definitely the cold because now the temperatures are supposed to go back up for the rest of the week mb high 70's low for no low 30's low 30's which is so doable so doable lot of the sun it's abundant sunshine but we're about to get up do some breakfast because we have a big day planned today we are going to yellowstone we have been to yellowstone before we had done every single part of the of yellowstone that you can drive to last time we were here however it was beautiful we came in from the north sunny warm then we set up camp and we got to see the mammoth geysers is that what it's called i don't remember i think it's mammoth we got to see all that their mammoth hot springs i think yeah it's mammoth hot springs everything on the north side we went to go set up camp and then the whole entire next day it rained and we went for four days straight it was miserable so we missed out i mean we went to go see things but we couldn't really see them so today we just want to go to the central part of yellowstone and get to revisit the things that we didn't get to enjoy because we couldn't see it because of all the rain that was happening so that is game plan of the day you ready yeah kelly had a really great idea which we put into motion this morning with that heater that we were talking about right there she said let's put up a tarp and block the wind and kind of refract some of that heat back towards us and that's what we did and it's working out very nicely it's it's actually really warm right in this region right kelly yeah it is compared to standing out there yeah but the sun's starting to come out and it's the first time we've seen the sun in two days or so one day oh well it feels a lot yesterday felt like a really long day but we are fishing to clean up dishes and get on the road again spend more time with the vehicle but that's only today we're gonna do more hikes tomorrow but we will see you at yellowstone we're pulling up to the check-in of yellowstone national park and we have our annual pass so once again we're gonna use this pass to get into this park so far we've used it at about five national parks this year and we hope to go to a few more before the end of the year so it's 80 dollars for the year and you can get it at the website would you then have it on here uh you just go to uh nationalparkservice.gov yeah and it'll it'll show you where to go and uh we actually picked this one up in bryce canyon in visitors center we went on our two week trip so we used it for all those national parks and we're gonna use it for this one and any other ones we plan to go to for the rest of the year so this is what it looks like we're waiting in line it's actually not that busy no today it's not bad and it's more overcast and cloudy here than it was where we were camping at so i don't know i don't know we'll see what happens we're at our first stop this is the midway geyser and it's really packed today so we had a park on the street and we're gonna take this bridge and go over this creek do you know what the name of the creek is don't give me the line i don't know i should have looked but let's go get on that boardwalk so [Music] this is the grand prismatic geyser and it's the most popular guys are around here so we're actually gonna hike up this trail right up here you can see it from above because you can't really see much down here we are on the ferry falls trail and it is a six mile loop but we're just gonna hike to the geyser overlook the guys that we were at earlier the grand prismatic that way we can see what it looks like from afar because when you're down right at it it's hard to see with all the fog coming up from it and it's only a mile to the overload so let's get started [Music] that was awesome well worth the hike that's the view i was looking for right there well we're about to get back down to the vehicle we'll see you there we have made it to the yellowstone falls and the cool thing about the yellowstone falls is that the canyon walls that line it are yellow and that is the origin of the name for yellowstone park but we're going to do the upper part of the lower falls first where it brings and goes down into the canyon it is 0.4 miles down to the bottom so we just met some people on the trail that watch our channel and they're from chicago yeah so this is junior and lucy hello so i just keep thinking about kayaking this we've done rivers that look like this and just could you imagine just coming up to that waterfall and like you're dead yeah like you can pour it out right here really quickly i think you'd be okay so that was yellowstone falls and now y'all are probably wondering when are y'all going to shower hey we got a shower on the way we did y'all didn't see that we did we showered two days ago okay but still uh so when we were here a couple years ago we stayed at a campground in the canyon village and they had showers so we're gonna go over there see if we can go and take a shower and then head back to camp camp so i can cook dinner and tetons so we'll let you know how the shower situation turns out so we took a shower at headwaters campground it's kind of in between grand teton and yellowstone and we are very thankful that we have we had that shower best um shower culture bay closes at seven o'clock and we were not gonna make it we're still probably 30 45 minutes out and it's 7 20 now but um we are happy we're clean and now we're gonna head to town it's too late now for me to cook by the time i get back and start cooking yadda yadda it's just gonna be too late so we're gonna head back into jackson and find something to eat for dinner so we'll see you there [Music] so [Music] so that was jackson drug that we ate at it was pretty good okay so i had a delicious elk burger and i had huckleberry ice cream yeah we didn't get that on the vlog because we actually smashed that pretty hard pretty quick i'm trying to figure
