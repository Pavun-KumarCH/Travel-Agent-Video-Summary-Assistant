"BEST THINGS TO DO IN AMSTERDAM FOR FIRST TIMERS W/ MAP (2024) | 20+ Must-Dos, Hidden Gems & More!",19:39,203105,Happy to Wander,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqYvuRXwaVA,"The incredible city of Amsterdam is one of those 
places that has a little something for everyone,   whether your idea of fun is getting drunk on 
a boat with bottomless cheese cubes or darting   from museum to museum until your sanity begs 
for mercy! And if you need help deciding what   to do, this video will cover the best things to do 
in Amsterdam alongside which overhyped activities   to skip because there's definitely quite a 
few tourist traps to avoid. Be sure to stick   around until the end for a free map of all these 
activities and extra resources to help you plan   your dream Amsterdam itinerary. In case you're new 
here, hi, I'm Christina from HappyToWander.com and   this channel is all about practical travel tips 
from someone who's been there, done that, so be   sure to like and subscribe for more travel videos 
just like this one. And just a final money-saving   tip before we begin, if you plan to do a lot of 
paid attractions during your time in Amsterdam   it may be worthwhile to get an iAmsterdam card, 
which includes most major attractions for one set   price but as usual be sure to crunch the numbers 
and see if it's worth it for you. Now, let's move   on to the list. Number one: a canal cruise. If 
you're looking for the best most Amsterdammy   thing to do during your visit, my friend, it's time 
to hurl yourself on a boat. Is it painfully cliched?   Sure, but if there's only one touristy thing you 
treat yourself to in Amsterdam a canal cruise is   non-negotiable. Honestly, this is the best way 
to admire the city and get a quick overview   of its famous picturesque canals, plus for bonus fun 
points you could book really indulgent ones like   a bottom wine and cheese cruise, which I can vouch 
for having done it myself recently. My tip? Go at   sunset, it is absolutely dreamy. Number two: the 
Red Light District. Of course, I couldn't make a   list of the most unique things to do in Amsterdam 
without including the Red Light District, so I'm   going to just get it out of the way. The Red Light 
District is an infamous and oft-misunderstood part   of Amsterdam, known the world over for legal 
prostitution, sex workers in windows, erotic   performances, erotic shops and even a whole museum 
about the history of prostitution. To be honest, I   don't think this area is a particularly exciting 
place to visit unless you're really into tourist   crowds, vape shops, dodging public urination and 
the everpresent scent of Mary Jane or you know,   actual prostitution, in which case go wild! But 
hey, the Red Light District is truly one of those   things that most visitors feel like they need to 
check off their list, so of course, go indulge your   curiosity but don't get your hopes up, I doubt 
a visit here will be the highlight of your trip.   And of course, remember to remain respectful and 
not take any photos where you're not supposed to.   Now for something a little more my speed, let's 
move on to number three which is to gorge on    stroopwafels. If there's one treat you need to try in 
Amsterdam, make sure it's this one. Stroopwafels are a very thin cookie-like treat that are made 
by sandwiching two thin waffle wafers together   with a caramelly filling in the middle. They 
originated in Gouda and are absolutely delicious,   especially if eaten while warm. As a purist, I must 
implore you to try a plain one rather than one of   the more aesthetic ones coated in chocolate and 
other toppings. A truly excellent stroopwafel   will shine just fine on its own and they don't 
need to be fancy or expensive either. I personally   have a soft spot for the big multi-packs you buy 
from the supermarket but don't let the foodies   know I told you that. Moving on to number four, 
which is to stuff your face with all manner of   fried snacks. Amsterdam is known as a city of vice 
and indulgence and if your indulgences come in the   form of mysterious things deep-fried to oblivion, 
I have great news! Dutch food is a true wonder,   from chocolate sprinkles on toast for breakfast 
to tiny bite-sized pancakes doused in sugar, there   is no caloric limit to what these magically tall 
people consume. Some of the best treats though are   the fried ones and honestly, if you're looking for 
fun things to do in Amsterdam I'd like to suggest   a grand tour of the Netherlands' most prized snacks, 
including fries, usually served in a creamy sauce; bitterballen, which are small round deep-fried 
balls of a kind of beef stew that's been coated   in breadcrumbs; croquettes, which are mainly a 
bigger version of bitterballen but shaped like   a sausage and then deep fried; frikandel, which is 
sort of like a Dutch hot dog although they don't   look super appetizing, I can vouch that they're 
very delicious; and kaassoufflée, think of a crumbed and   deep-fried croquet only flat and it's filled with 
gooey cheese. Now let's move on to some of the more   cultural things to do in Amsterdam, starting with 
number five: getting your culture on at the Rijksmuseum   AKA the National Museum of the Netherlands. 
The Rijksmuseum is to Amsterdam as the Louvre is to   Paris, it's an astounding collection of 8,000 plus 
pieces representing centuries of Dutch art and   history, all housed in a grand building that will 
give you neck pains from all the inevitable oohing   and aahing. But, and I say this with love, do not 
force yourself to go to the Rijksmuseum if   you are not particularly interested in art and 
history, it's expensive, busy and quite a time   commitment given the museum's massive size. If 
you only have a short time in Amsterdam, I might   recommend stopping by to admire the building's 
exterior then focusing on some of the other   activities in this video. If you do decide to go 
though, here's my tip: visit just before closing to   avoid the crowds and don't miss the hidden library.
By the way, one of my favorite Amsterdam fun facts   is that there's actually a branch of the Rijksmuseum 
at the Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, the first   museum to be opened in an airport, period, which is 
pretty special. And if you're more into modern art   then the nearby Stedelijk Museum may be more your speed. 
It's dedicated to modern art and design with lots   of bold and interesting installations. Located a 
nerdy skip away from the Rijksmuseum is another one   of Amsterdam's most famous cultural must-dos: the 
Van Gogh Museum or, if you're pronouncing it the   proper Dutch way, the ""Van Gogh"" Museum. This is one 
spot I'd recommend to anyone who is familiar with   Van Gogh and is a fan of his work. After all, this 
is the world's largest collection of his works   with hundreds of paintings, drawings and letters on 
display for your nosy perusal. While here, not only   do you get to treat your eyeballs to some of the 
most famous and well-known paintings in history,   they're all contextualized beautifully with 
tidbits about Van Gogh's life story. If you're easily   moved like me or perhaps just hormonal, also like 
me, then this Amsterdam must-do may make you a bit   emotional, so bring tissues. Onwards to number seven 
which is to stop by the world's largest street   art museum. Straat is one of the coolest museums in 
Amsterdam hands down, located across the river and   about a 10-minute free ferry ride from Amsterdam 
Central Station, in the NDSM-Werf neighborhood. Once   you get there, look for the giant mural of Anne Frank 
and then head inside what was once a shipbuilding   warehouse to see a massive museum dedicated to 
street art. This huge space is filled with equally   large canvases, along with some quirky installation 
art and sculptures, including a truck hanging from   the ceiling with murals on each side of it. The 
pieces on display here are truly breathtaking   and there are more than 160 artworks by over 150 
artists from all around the world. There's even a   cool interactive art piece in one of the side 
rooms and the cafe looking out over everything   is also a great spot for some refreshment. Onwards 
to number eight which is a big one and that is to   visit a quirky museum. Listen, if I were to 
continue listing every single Amsterdam museum   as a must-do, we would be here for weeks and I'm 
sure you want to get back to your loved ones   in a timely manner, so let's just summarize some of 
the funnier weirder ones I think you might like. In   Amsterdam you'll find a truly eclectic selection 
of museums which is why sometimes buying an   iAmsterdam card can be really great because you 
can see some of the smaller ones and feel like   it's a better deal because it's all included. For 
instance, in the past I visited the Pipe Museum but   in addition to that, there's also the Upside Down 
Museum, the Katten Kabinet Museum, which is dedicated   to art depicting cats and also Our House, which is 
an immersive museum experience dedicated to dance   music, with exhibitions on the history of dance 
music along with installations, immersive shows   and DJ-curated exhibits. Of course, besides visiting 
museums one of the top must-dos in Amsterdam is to   simply photograph your heart out. Amsterdam is 
one of the most aesthetically pleasing cities   in Europe with narrow crooked houses squished 
against each other lining picturesque canals as   an endless stream of bikes glide over bridges like 
some kind of utopian postcard. Honestly, one of the   best things to do in Amsterdam is just stare at 
everything and drool. I'd be happy spending days   doing just that but if you're wondering where 
exactly to drool here are some can't miss photo   spots: first, Damrak. Just outside of Amsterdam 
Centraal Station is an avenue known as Damrak,   here is where you can get a shot of the famous 
dancing houses in Amsterdam that you've no doubt   seen many times before, a set of crooked canal 
houses just behind some water where lots of canal   tours depart. Close by you'll find Dam Square, which 
is Amsterdam's most famous square. Be sure to visit   the inside of the Royal Palace if you can but 
otherwise beware of pigeons here, they are awful.   Another beautiful photo spot is the neighborhood 
known as Jordaan, to the west of the city center.   This area is known as one of Amsterdam's prettiest 
neighborhoods, where you'll find many cute cafes,   restaurants, boutique shops, hotels and homes lining 
canals. Finally, there's the Skinny Bridge. Amsterdam   is known for its many bridges crossing all its 
canals but the Skinny Bridge might be the most   famous. This picturesque wooden bridge was featured 
in the 1971 James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever   and at night it's lit up by tons of little light 
bulbs, making it very cute and romantic. Now, let's   move on to number 10. Of course, it wouldn't be 
a list of unique Amsterdam experiences without   mentioning the famous Anne Frank House, by far one 
of the most solemn but important places that the   city contains. Anne Frank was a German-born Jewish 
girl who was living in Amsterdam when the Nazis   invaded and subsequently spent 2 years hiding 
with her family in tiny concealed rooms at the   place where her father had worked. She kept a diary 
during this period which was published after her   death by her father and it is now one of the most 
well-known books in the world. And when you're in   Amsterdam, if this piece of history interests 
you, you can actually visit the building and   rooms where Anne spent those years of her life in 
hiding. This was, by far, one of the most memorable stops   on my first visit to Amsterdam and now, almost a 
decade later, I can still remember the way it felt   to walk within those same four walls where Anne 
penned her famous diary over 70 years ago. This   is definitely a tough but important place to visit. 
Moving on to number 11, another must-do in Amsterdam   is a bumble through De Negen Straatjes, the Nine Streets. I'm sure I butchered that name in Dutch but let's just go   with it! This area is located within the Jordaan, 
right in the middle of the UNESCO World Heritage   Site section of canals. Many of the businesses here 
are located in original canal houses making it   infinitely charming to explore, plus some of the 
city's quirkier museums can be found here as well,   so be sure to allocate some time to exploring 
this neighborhood, it's absolutely stunning. Now   the next thing to do in Amsterdam, is to enjoy 
an amazing view. There's no shortage of places   for a view in the city, which is why one of my 
favorite things to do in Amsterdam is simply hunt   for the best one. Some that I can highly recommend 
including the rooftop terrace at the NEMO Science   Museum, the rooftop view from the OBA library or, if 
you're looking for paid views, there's also the A'DAM   Lookout or the DoubleTree by Hilton Sky Lounge, 
which is a gorgeous rooftop bar that's perfect   for enjoying a cocktail and some bar snacks while 
watching the sunset. Now another fun thing to do in   Amsterdam is visiting the world's only floating 
flower market. On Amsterdam Singel canal is a   stretch of flower stalls that are all located on 
floating platforms on the the water. This flower   market is the only floating market of its kind and 
a great spot to buy some fresh tulips, tulip bulbs   or other tulip-themed souvenirs. I'll be honest, this 
is a very touristy spot and for the most part, you   don't even realize you're standing on a floating 
market at all. Nonetheless, it's a nice spot to   quickly browse especially if you're aggressively 
into tulips. Now on to number 14, which is a hidden   gem of Amsterdam and that's to find some peace at 
the Begijnhof. Hofs or hofjes, which means courtyards, are   basically little gardens surrounded by homes and 
the Beghijnhof is one of the most beautiful in Amsterdam   and the most famous. Constructed in the Middle Ages 
it's actually located below modern street level,   so you go through a little archway and down into 
a garden that's hidden from the surrounding busy   streets. There are two churches located within 
this inner garden/courtyard area and it's a   beautiful place to escape the crowds for a little 
moment. Now onwards to number 15, which is to snoop   around a canal house. The ultraslim canal houses of 
Amsterdam are one of the city's signature elements   but do you know what's better than gawking at 
them from afar? Getting to step inside one. Of   course, there's a few ways to do that including 
staying in a canal house hotel, visiting a museum   inside a canal house or booking a restaurant or 
bar housed inside one. Regardless of how you do   it, make sure you take some time to explore one 
of these canal houses because there is nothing   more quintessentially Amsterdam. And speaking 
of quintessentially Amsterdam, number 16 is to   snoop around a houseboat. Another distinctive thing 
that makes Amsterdam Amsterdam is its multitude of   houseboats. Again, there are a few ways to check 
out the inside of one, starting with staying in   a houseboat yourself or visiting the Houseboat 
Museum. This is basically just a houseboat that   you can go into to have a look around and while 
it's not too expensive, it's also very small, so   I wouldn't necessarily recommend it unless you're 
very very nosy. Now if you're looking to get a bit   more off the beaten path in Amsterdam, I can 
highly recommend exploring the city's Jewish   Quarter. Today, there are a number of historically 
important preserved buildings here to explore. The   Jewish Cultural Quarter is an organization that 
manages all the places that you can visit here   and is dedicated to preserving Jewish culture in 
Amsterdam. One ticket will gain you access to the   Portuguese Synagogue, the Jewish Historical Museum 
and a few other attractions in the area. This is   definitely a very unique and interesting area to 
explore, so be sure to put it on your list. Another   cool neighborhood to explore in Amsterdam is De
Pjip. This is a cool neighborhood in the old south   of the city which used to be a working-class area 
but is now a multicultural and bohemian zone brimming   with cafes, restaurants, coffee shops and bars. 
It's also home to the famous Albert Cuyp Markt,   the largest daily market in Europe, which takes 
place Monday to Saturday from 9:30 until 5:00,   and also an excellent spot to try some fresh 
local treats like stroopwafels, as well as   affordable groceries, clothing and more. In the 
complete opposite direction is another great   neighborhood worth checking out: Amsterdam Noord, 
which is directly across the river from Amsterdam   Centraal Station. Luckily, you can reach it in about 
3 minutes through a free ferry and from there you   can explore a bunch of attractions including the 
A'DAMToren (the Amsterdam Tower), the Eye Film Museum and   This Is Holland. At the Amsterdam Tower, you'll find 
a really cool viewing platform, a thrilling swing   ride, as well as a swanky revolving restaurant, 
cool cocktail bar, hotel, underground nightclub,   and a fun burger joint. This Is Holland is a really 
fun 5D flight simulator experience where you get   to virtually visit plenty of gorgeous places 
in the Netherlands through one single ticket.   The Eye Film Museum is also interesting if you're 
interested in the history of film. A bit further   up the river through a different ferry is the 
NDSM-Werf neighborhood. This is where the street art   museum I mentioned earlier is located but there 
are a number of artsy attractions and hip places   here to check out as well, so if you're looking for 
something a bit more offbeat to do in Amsterdam be   sure to pay this neighborhood a visit, especially 
when there's cool events taking place from dance   music festivals to the largest flea market in 
Europe. And if you're looking for a very unique   and interesting place to visit in Amsterdam be 
sure to visit this museum whose pronunciation   I have butchered too many times to attempt again! 
This museum is home to a fascinating secret church,   one of many clandestine churches that popped up 
in the 17th century when Catholics weren't able   to worship in public anymore. Built into the 
top floors of a canal house, the secret attic   church is one of the most interesting secrets 
of Amsterdam, although these days the secret's   pretty much out and there are a lot of visitors 
but this audio guide tour takes you through the   many floors, offering fascinating insight on the 
history of the house and what life was like back   in the day. Really, this is one of the few museums 
where I listened to every number on the audio guide,   it's that good and I highly recommend it. The next 
Amsterdam must-do is to get cozy in a brown cafe.  Brown cafes are informal neighborhood spots that 
serve beer and usually simple traditional meals,   they're known as brown cafes because of their 
typically brown interiors, with lots of dark brown   wood and dim lighting. I love visiting brown bars 
in the Netherlands because they're very homey, very   cozy and relaxed and a great place to chill after 
a very long day of sightseeing. Another Amsterdam   activity to add to your list is visiting the 
city's largest park. Amsterdam has no shortage of   lovely green spaces but Vondelpark is the largest 
and most popular. This park was opened in 1865 and   covers 120 acres of space, not far from the Museumplein. 
It's built with biking and walking paths, as   well as wide open spaces for picnics. In summer 
it can get very busy here but any time of year   is nice to explore the different sections and it's 
especially good for dog spotting. Another must-do   that I feel like most guides don't tell you about 
is enjoying Amsterdam's Secret Garden Days. Granted,   this is a very limited-time event but I happened to 
be in Amsterdam one year for this and I have to   include it because it's so cool. If you happen to 
be visiting in the summer there is a 3-day period   in Amsterdam known as the Open Garden Garden Days, 
where many of the city's secret gardens are made   accessible to the public. That's right, more than 
30 different canal houses open up their gardens   for 3 days each June, usually the third weekend 
of the month and if you purchase a ticket that   gives you free rein to visit all these different 
houses. Honestly, if you've ever wondered what the   canal houses look like on the inside or what 
their gardens look like, this is a super cool   event to attend. Lastly, it has to be said, for 
better or for worse Amsterdam is a city that   has tons of made-for-tourist activities that most 
locals would sneer at as they smugly glide past   on their bikes but hey, my philosophy with travel 
is that so long as you're enjoying it, it's not a   tourist trap, so with that in mind if you're still 
looking for fun things to do in Amsterdam here   are some final touristy Amsterdam activities you 
might find interesting. For instance, you can hop   on a beer bike tour, you can indulge in the Heineken 
Experience and tour the original Heineken Brewery,   or if you're traveling with kids and looking for 
something to do on a rainy day, there's also the   touristy classics like Madame Tussauds, Ripley's Believe 
It or Not, and the Amsterdam Dungeon. That said, I   wouldn't necessarily recommend these activities 
because there are way better things to be doing   but if it appeals to you, now you know. Oh, and a 
final note, unless you're a very competent cyclist   I wouldn't do a bike tour here. Amsterdam cyclists 
are ruthless and have no patience for lost   tourists. Now all that said, I recognize that this 
video is barely scraping the surface. Amsterdam   is an amazing city with more to do than I could 
ever cover in one video and tons of amazing day   trips too but let me know in the comments what 
activities you would add and be sure to like and   subscribe for more practical travel videos just 
like this one. I'll see you guys next week, bye!","If there's one thing you need to try in Amsterdam, make sure it's stroopwafels. The Red Light District is an infamous and oft-misunderstood part of Amsterdam. If you're looking for the best most Amsterdammy thing to do during your visit, it's time to hurl yourself on a boat. The Rijksmuseum is to Amsterdam as the Louvre is to Paris, it's an astounding collection of 8,000 plus pieces.
